# Strongholds
## Summary
Strongholds is a web-based autonomous multiplayer game, accessed through a RESTful API. 

Inspired by games such as https://spacetraders.io/.
The game can be played through the provided client `Strongholds` or by interacting directly with the `StrongholdsAPI`.

The client and server are both built using ASP.NET. 
The API uses Entity Framework Core to define the DB schema using a code-first approach.

## Mood
You find yourself stranded inside a 'station' on the surface of a distant planet. 
You've worked here the last 5 years without so much as a power surge. 
But now you find yourself confronted by the inevitable.

Comms are down. The Relay station is unreachable. And you're running low on supplies.

Your only means of survival is to harness what little you have left.
The outside is inhospitable. You send out the station's basic robot in search of supplies.
After an anxious wait the bot returns. 
Why did it take so long?
A dimly lit screen on the bot reads out the log report.
